# Heart-disease-regression-website

The Dataset has three columns; biking, smoking and heart.disease.
Heart.Disease is the target column. I have used regression model to predict the percentage of population having heart disease given smoking population percentage and percentage of population biking.
The website prompts user to enter percentage of smoking and biking population and based on that it gives the output, that is, percentage of population having heart disease.
I have deployed the model using flask.
